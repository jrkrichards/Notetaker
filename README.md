# Note Taker

## Description

This application allows the users to save notes to the backend using express and node.js. After a new note is added through the input form the save icon on the top right will appear. When the user clicks the save icon the note will save to the db and will display the title on the left hand side. When the user wants to view previously saved notes they can click on the titles on the left side to display the note. When a user want to write new note they can click the pen and it will change the form from read-only to writeable.
